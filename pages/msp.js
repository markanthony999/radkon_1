				<h1>THE IT DEPARTMENT </h1>
				<p>
					IT Departments are vital to the success of a company. Maybe even more
					important than sales. Just like with any critical department, most
					organizations create a budget to cover the expenses. Depending on the
					size and revenue of an organization, different avenues of achieving
					technology support and cybersecurity may be taken. The biggest
					constraint that any organization will face is funding. IT support and
					cybersecurity should be important to any organization, no matter the
					size. Bad guys are out there, and they do not discriminate.{' '}
				</p>
				<p>
					There are three models that one should consider when creating or
					revamping their IT department. Your budget will determine which of the
					three models you should take. One model is to fully staff your own IT
					department. Second model is to form a hybrid IT department, and
					finally the third model is to outsource your IT department to a
					trusted company.
				</p>
				<h1>WHAT IS AN IT DEPARTMENT?</h1>
				<p>
					Before diving into the three models, let us define an IT department
					and summarize its responsibilities. An IT department should consist of
					a helpdesk, asset maintenance, asset inventory, monitoring, upgrades,
					and security. The most common responsibility that most people are
					familiar with is the helpdesk. When an employee has a problem with a
					printer, program, or system, they will call the helpdesk for
					assistance. Helpdesk mainly deals with break/fix problems. If
					something is not working the helpdesk gets notified and deals with the
					problem, in the moment.
				</p>
				<p>
					{' '}
					Maintaining your system and technology assets will help limit the
					calls to your helpdesk, but maintaining your assets also affects other
					parts of your organization. Not only from potential network down time,
					but also your organization’s security. Routine maintenance will catch
					vulnerabilities faster, remediate critical issues and have your
					systems running smoother.{' '}
				</p>
				<p>
					Knowing what devices exist on your network is imperative to your
					security. It also helps you to stay in compliance. Maintaining a
					proper inventory of devices on your network will allow you to provide
					detail reports during Microsoft audits, as well as knowing which
					devices are fully licensed. A good inventory will also help you plan
					hardware upgrade projects and keeping up with warranties.{' '}
				</p>
				<p>
					Monitoring your network is also important. It gives you both the
					benefit of knowing what devices are on your network and what type of
					activity is happening. Intrusion detection systems will help with
					possible security breaches. A malware scanner on the network will help
					block files from making their way to your employees’ computers.
					Content filters will help keep your employees focused. But all these
					tools have reports that need to be analyzed by your IT team.
				</p>
				<p>
					{' '}
					Finally, the security responsibility. Threats are growing and internet
					security should be one of your priorities when building your IT
					department. All the above-mentioned responsibilities play a key role
					in your organizations’ cybersecurity. Keeping systems up to date, and
					monitoring the network and devices are parts of the security strategy.
					One of the missed aspects of cybersecurity is employee training. Your
					employees are the first line of defense when it comes to securing your
					data. Your IT department should make sure that your employees are
					prepared for possible attacks. Simulated phishing, short educational
					videos, quick quizzes, and analytic tools will help you prepare your
					employees for the next attack.
				</p>
				<p>
					{' '}
					Furthermore, part of your security should be a well created and tested
					disaster recovery plan. This plan should prepare your organization for
					restoring your system when you get hit by malware. There are more
					details of the responsibilities listed above, but we do not need to go
					into detail in this article.
				</p>
				<h1> THE THREE MODELS OF AN IT DEPARTMENT</h1>
				<p>
					{' '}
					One of the models that has been in practice for years is fully
					staffing your own IT department. This strategy is the most expansive
					out of all three. Some organizations are too small to be able to
					afford a fully staffed IT department or are too small to have work for
					all the employees for a 40hr work week.
				</p>
				<p>
					{' '}
					Looking at each role of the IT department here are the average
					salaries in the Chicagoland area:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Help Desk is $48,093 (Indeed, 2021) > </li>
					<li>Network administrator is $68,124 (Indeed, 2021) ></li>
					<li>System administrator $77,002 (Indeed, 2021) ></li>
					<li>Compliance office is $74,159 (Indeed, 2021) ></li>
					<li>Cybersecurity engineer $101,734 (Indeed, 2021)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Depending on the size of your organization you may need multiple
					personnel in each job description. Let us say that you only need one
					person for each job description. Yearly, you will be paying on average
					$369,112. That does not include benefits and workers compensation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Taking this into consideration, organizations are starting to move
					into the other three models: fully outsourcing or hybrid. In fully
					outsourced model, an organization would rely on a Managed Service
					Provider (MSP), like Radkon, to handle help desk, asset maintenance,
					asset inventory, monitoring, upgrades, security, and disaster
					recovery. The MSP becomes part of your organization, getting to know
					your employees.
				</p>
				<p>
					{' '}
					In a hybrid model an organization would hire professionals they could
					afford and supplement the remaining responsibilities with a Managed
					Service Provider (MSP), like Radkon. Your staffed IT would work
					together with an MSP to complete projects that otherwise would be not
					done. Furthermore, an MSP can involve experienced professionals to
					fill in the gaps, that your hired IT personal do not have experience
					in.
				</p>
				<h1> WHY SHOULD I CHOOSE AN MSP FOR MY IT NEEDS?</h1>
				<h1>PARTNERSHIPS</h1>
				<p>
					{' '}
					A managed service provider has built relationships with companies and
					individuals in the technology sector. Whether it may be a manufacturer
					or a leading cybersecurity community. When you partner with an MSP
					your organization gains access to the resources of those
					organizations. It can almost be compared to a private club, where you
					get to meet professionals and use their knowledge to maintain and
					strengthen your company’s technology footprint.
				</p>
				<h1>WE ARE ALWAYS THERE</h1>
				<p>
					{' '}
					When you are running your own organization or making sure that your
					network is operating at its peak performance. You should have someone
					to call when problems arise on your network. You cannot afford any
					downtime because downtime means lost revenue. With Radkon, there is
					always someone on the other side of the phone to answer your call-in
					need. An MSP does not take vacations or sick days, and your dedicated
					representative will get to know your organization, network and needs.{' '}
				</p>
				<h1>COST</h1>
				<p>
					Most of our day-to-day IT support services are based on a monthly
					subscription package. We take preventative measures to maintain the IT
					infrastructure, in such a way to minimize outages and breaks. Unlike
					Break/fix approach we can provide you with a monthly cost, so that you
					know how much you need to budget for. But let us be realistic, life is
					unpredictable and unusual events and problems arise. When this
					happens, and the problem is outside of the subscription scope we
					charge a discounted hourly rate for services. Even if such a scenario
					arises, your IT costs will be still lower than going with full
					staffing model.
				</p>
				<p>
					90% of executives stated they use or plan to utilize managed services
					to avoid large CapEx costs.
				</p>
				<h1>HOW DO I KNOW WHICH MODEL I SHOULD CHOOSE?</h1>
				<p>
					All organizations, no matter the size, should have access to an IT
					professional but choosing whether to hire someone or outsource will
					depend on a few factors. The main thing to consider is cost. Does your
					organization have the budget to hire a full time IT professional? As
					mentioned before hiring a professional can be a costly venture and not
					all organizations can afford all the professionals needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					{' '}
					In some cases, you need to have an IT professional on staff especially
					when you have in house written software that needs to be managed or an
					SAP system that needs constant maintenance and support. An MSP is not
					“be all end all”, it is not perfect, and no MSP can do everything.
					Nevertheless, you can utilize an MSPs connection and networking
					channels to find and hire support for the areas that an MSP lacks.
					When choosing a MSP, remember that you must trust the company you are
					going to work with, you should have a good relationship with your MSP,
					like a trusted advisor and MSP will look out for your best interest.
					You must ask yourself, “Would it be beneficial for me to supplement
					some of the roles with an MSP?”
				</p>
				<p>
					There are also cases where it will be beneficial to outsource all your
					IT needs to an MSP. This could be driven by the need for cost savings
					or the avoidance of staffing. This decision could also be driven by
					the need to have reliable and always available IT professionals to
					contact at any time.
