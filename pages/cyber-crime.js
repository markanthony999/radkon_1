			<h1>CYBER CRIMINALS GOING AFTER SMALL BUSINESSES</h1>
			<p>
				{' '}
				A hacker depicted as a person in a grey hoody, gloves and mask stading
				with a laptop in the server room. The hacker is also holding a credit or
				debit card. As technology became a way of life and intertwines with our
				business operations, it has become a target for criminals around the
				World. Network infrastructure/and the devices housed within them, become
				weapons of destruction for small businesses. Already struggling from the
				financial impacts of the pandemic, small businesses are ultimately
				failing. Having to close their doors after a devastating attack from an
				unseen attacker. On July 27, 2021, the United State Senate held a
				hearing, regarding the ever-growing ransomware attacks on businesses in
				the United States. Highlighting the fact that small businesses aren’t
				immune or excluded from being a target. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa)
				in his opening statement said:
			</p>
			<p>
				{' '}
				"Ransomware does not just affect the deeper pockets of large companies
				like Colonial Pipeline and JBS. An estimated three out of every four
				victims of ransomware is a small business. Small businesses already
				operate on thin margins, and many have been pushed to the brink by the
				pandemic."
			</p>
			<p>
				{' '}
				The most shocking piece of information provided in the opening statement
				was how easily criminals can deploy the attacks. Many of us have heard
				of the cloud and the easily accessible programs that make our lives
				easier. From QuickBooks to GoDaddy, these providers maintain our
				accounting tools or host our websites, without us worrying about the
				infrastructure or the code behind it. Making it easier for small
				business owners to focus on their tasks.{' '}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now imagine that a similar type of environment is offered to criminals.
				In Senator Grassley’s opening statement, he mentioned countries that
				house criminal organizations that offer “Ransomware as a Service.”
				Making it easier for the criminals to deploy and maintain attacks. So
				don’t think that as a small business you are not a target! With ease of
				deployment and automation the attacks can reach all types of companies.
				As the giants of the corporate world strengthen their defenses, it is
				going to be the small guy, the low hanging fruit that criminals go
				after.

			<h1>HOW CAN YOU STRENGTHEN YOUR CYBERSECURITY AS A SMALL BUSINESS?</h1>
			<p>
				For the ever-growing need of cybersecurity Radkon is offering an
				affordable package for small businesses to get them started on the basic
				security needs. Just as Jeremy Sheridan, director of the Secret Service
				Cyber Fraud Task Forces pointed out “Even simple steps – such as keeping
				operating systems, software, and applications up-to-date and patched, or
				making sure that anti-virus and anti-malware solutions automatically
				update and run regular scans can significantly raise an organization’s
				defensive posture.”
			</p>
			<p>
				{' '}
				Radkon goes a step further and includes 24/7 cybersecurity monitoring
				service with the basic package. By utilizing artificial intelligence and
				veteran cybersecurity experts. They monitor, isolate and remediate
				threats on your devices. During the initial implementation, Radkon will
				work with you on creating a timeline of your cybersecurity needs with an
				included risk assessment.
			</p>
			<p>
				As Dick Durbin (D-IL) pointed out “Though any person or entity can be
				targeted in a ransomware attack, it has been estimated that small
				businesses make up over half of the victims. And these attacks can have
				permanent damage. Last year, it took an average of nine months for a
				business to fully recover from a ransomware attack.” Keeping these
				statistics in mind, can your business survive an attack? Are you
				prepared? Let us help you travers the unknown waters of Cybersecurity.
				Contact us today for more information, and to start the journey of
