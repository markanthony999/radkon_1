						Computers have changed the way we do business whether we are
						offering a service or selling goods. Today’s companies have to stay
						up to date with technology to provide a better service, as well as
						cut on costs of doing business. A well-designed network can help
						companies improve their productivity and lower the coasts. Newer
						computers can provide a faster computation power as well as less
						worry of downtime.
					</p>

					<p>
						Furthermore, all the data that the company has is valuable. So data
						backup is an important part of doing business, as well as keeping
						the data secure. A company can be devastated when most, if not all,
						of their data is lost due to a hard drive failure.

						Radkon is devoted in providing the best quality of products and
						installation. We will personally design a network that will fit your
						need, as well as provide you with different models of computers to
						choose from. We can also set up backup systems that can store your
						files securely on- or off-site. With most systems data can be set to
						back up every time a change was made to the file, or on a set
						schedule. This will ensure that your files are backed up in a timely
						manner.{' '}

						<summary>BACKUP SOLUTIONS</summary>
						<p>
							Radkon provides an on site device that stores all your backups.
							After completing a backup of your computers or servers to the
							device, the backups are encrypted and send to the cloud for
							storage. Included is a once-a-year recovery test and
							virtualization of your computer(s) or server(s) in the cloud. *30
							Day per year cloud virtualization of the backup machines.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the event your servers experience hardware failure, we can
							virtualize the damaged servers in the cloud. Providing minimum
							downtime during your hardware repair. Radkon can also provide
							onsite virtualization. Unlike the cloud virtualization we utilize
							the backup device as a host. On it we spin the latest backup of
							the damaged server. Once the server hardware is repaired, the
							current image running on the backup device gets transferred to the
							fixed server. Minimizing downtime. All settings and IP remain the
							same.
