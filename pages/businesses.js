			<h1>What We Do</h1>
			<h1>HELPING BUSINESSES</h1>
			<p>
				Computers have changed the way we do business whether we are offering a
				service or selling goods. Todayâ€™s companies have to stay up to date with
				technology to provide a better service, as well as cut on costs of doing
				business. A well-designed network can help companies improve their
				productivity and lower the coasts. Newer computers can provide a faster
				computation power as well as less worry of downtime.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, all the data that the company has is valuable. So data
				backup is an important part of doing business, as well as keeping the
				data secure. A company can be devastated when most, if not all, of their
				data is lost due to a hard drive failure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Radkon is devoted in providing the best quality of products and
				installation. We will personally design a network that will fit your
				need, as well as provide you with different models of computers to
				choose from. We can also set up backup systems that can store your files
				securely on- or off-site. With most systems data can be set to back up
				every time a change was made to the file, or on a set schedule. This
				will ensure that your files are backed up in a timely manner.{' '}
